hsv(col) - Converts a color (col) from RGB scale to HSV

		   col[0], col[1], col[2] should be the B, G , R respectively
		   This order is made to ensure consistency with OpenCV library.

class Image

init(data) -		Creates a virtual image 
					data is the 3D array of the image

					The dimensions are x, y coordinate and color(in BGR) respectively
					OpenCV stores it in a COLUMN MAJOR form
					This function is consistent with that format only.

dimensions() - 		Calculates the dimensions of the given image

toHSV() - 			Converts entire image to HSV scale pixelwise

components() - 		Extracts the H, S, V components from HSV image

centre() - 			Calculates the 'central tendency' of the background color

similar(col) - 		Checks col(in HSV) is 'similar enough' to the central background color or not

chroma(bg=None,		Identifies the background portion of the image by iteratively calling
col=None, 			similar() pixelwise. If bg is specified, background is replaced by
overwrite=True)		corresponding pixel in bg. Otherwise if col is specified, background is 
					replaced with col. If none is specified, bg is replaced with white.
					If overwrite is True, the original is image is overwritten
					If overwrite is False, a new image is returned
